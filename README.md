SPACE ALLOCATION PLANNER USING C++
This project is a simple home planner designed for beginners who are just starting to learn programming in C++. The program allows users to sign up with a unique username and password, and then log in to access the home planning features. Users can input the length and breadth of their house, and the program calculates the total area. The application then allocates space for a bedroom, kitchen, hall, and bathroom based on predefined dimensions.
